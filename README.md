# MoonBit Snippets

I have written some very technical and interesting MoonBit code snippets, but they are not enough to be a package / lack of further extension, hence I put them here.

## Table of Contents

- [Automatic differentiation and multi-param trait approach](./src/diff.mbt)
- [Hyperfunctions and zip](./src/hyper.mbt)
- [Extensible variant types and dynamic map](./src/dyn.mbt)
